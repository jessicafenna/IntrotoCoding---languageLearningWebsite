<h3>Why did I start learning languages?</h3> 
</section>

<p>
I was brought up in a monolingual English-speaking family, however, there was a local French club for children and I begged my parents to let me go. There we learned some French words and played games, so it was a taste of another language, in a very friendly and supportive environment, even though I didn’t learn it to any great degree of fluency, and even now I don’t have a great deal of knowledge of French, it awakened my interest in languages. 
<br> <br>
Having said all this, my first true love was Spanish, it was a language that really helped me to grow into myself. I was quite a shy and awkward teenager, who often felt out of place and anxious. Taking this deep dive into a new language, learning about the culture and the customs was a form of escapism for me. What is more, learning to express myself in such a novel way, where I almost expected to be misunderstood, where the words were more limited to me, the expressions were new etc. was really refreshing and I found that I could step into this almost alternative personality, that was really freeing. Whilst I was a student, I also tried learning some other languages, Italian and Japanese, for varying lengths of time.
<br><br>
However, as an adult, life got in the way a little of my language learning and I stepped away from it for a number of years, though Spanish was always in the background of my life. I still engaged with the culture, with friends in that language, but I didn’t actively study.
<br><br>
It wasn’t until the onset of the pandemic that my passion for languages was reawakened, through a series of fairly random events. Whilst the world became inevitably shut off due the pandemic and the idea of travelling became impossible, I simultaneously started working as an English language tutor to students in China and South Korea, which, once again, opened me up to new cultures and as a result, new languages to learn. 
<br><br>
At this time, as well, is when I really started to understand and engage with the possible link between positive mental wellbeing and language learning. As I mentioned before, I was going through some of my own mental health struggles and as I received help for this, I started to even more actively engage with language learning. And I do my recovery was aided by this.
<br><br>
Language learning can be a way of travelling mentally, opening up yourself to new aspects of the world, or at least new ways of seeing and looking at it. So, last year, I started to actively learn again with a renewed enthusiasm.
